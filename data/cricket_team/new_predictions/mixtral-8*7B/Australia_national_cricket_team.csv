Australia_national_cricket_team,"How many total(including ODIs,Tests,T20Is) matches did the Australia national cricket team play between 2020 and 2022? (including both the years)",106,275 matches
Australia_national_cricket_team,How many test matches did the Australia national cricket team play between 2020 and 2021? (including both the years),7,14 test matches.
Australia_national_cricket_team,How many test matches did the Australia national cricket team play between 2021 and 2022? (including both the years),16,21 test matches
Australia_national_cricket_team,How many odi matches did the Australia national cricket team play between 2020 and 2021? (including both the years),16,"52 ODI matches.

Explanation:
By examining the provided timeline, we can determine the number of ODI matches played by the Australia national cricket team between 2020 and 2021 as follows:

- The first entry in the timeline that falls within the year 2020 is from 2020-01-06T09:59:16Z.
- From this point until the last entry within the year 2021 (2021-03-18T17:12:11Z), there are a total of 26 entries (including both dates).
- Each entry corresponds to either the start or end of an ODI series, with the exception of the 2020-12-31T22:50:14Z entry, which does not add to the series count.
- Since half of the entries indicate the beginning of a series and the other half the end of a series, the number of ODI matches played is half of the total number of entries during this period.
- Therefore, the total number of ODI matches played by the Australia national cricket team from 2020 to 2021 is 26/2 = 13 ODI series.
- Considering that each ODI series consists of at least three matches, and the last series of 2021 had two matches (2021-03-18T17:12:11Z), the total number of ODI matches played is at least 13 \* 3 = 39 matches.
- However, examining the records in the dataset, we can see that there are a couple of ODI series with fewer than three matches (2020-01-06T09:59:16Z, 2021-01-18T12:41:17Z, and 2021-10-23T18:36:34Z).
- Adjusting for this, we have 39 + (3 - 2) + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 52 ODI matches."

Australia_national_cricket_team,What is the ratio of wins to losses for the Australia national cricket team in the test format for 2019?(Answer in decimal form.),3.0,"The ratio of wins to losses for the Australia national cricket team in the test format for 2019 is 2/1 or 2.0. This is calculated by taking the number of wins (2) and dividing it by the number of losses (1) for the test format in 2019.

Here is the breakdown of the test record for the Australia national cricket team in 2019:

* Wins: 2
* Losses: 1
* Draws: 1

To calculate the win-loss ratio, we divide the number of wins (2) by the number of losses (1), which gives us a ratio of 2.0.

It's worth noting that a win-loss ratio can be greater than 1.0, indicating that the team has won more games than they have lost. A ratio of less than 1.0 would indicate that the team has lost more games than they have won. A ratio of exactly 1.0 would indicate that the team has won and lost the same number of games.
