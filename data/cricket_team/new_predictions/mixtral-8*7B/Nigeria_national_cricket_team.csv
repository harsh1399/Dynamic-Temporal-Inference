Nigeria_national_cricket_team,Does the Nigeria national cricket team have the best win percentage in the t20i format in 2019 or 2022?(Answer in year)(Include no results/ties/draws in total number of matches.),2022,"2022 (based on available data)

Explanation:
The given timeline provides two data points for the year 2019 and two data points for the years 2022 and 2023. Since the question asks about 2019 or 2022, we can compare the two data points available for 2022.

In 2022, the Nigeria national cricket team played 5 T20I matches, winning 0 and losing 5 (with 1 no result). This results in a win percentage of 0%.

Although the question asks for the best win percentage, the given timeline only shows data points for 2022 with a win percentage of 0%. Hence, the answer is 2022. There is no data for 2019 that is directly comparable to the 2022 data as the number of matches played is different."
