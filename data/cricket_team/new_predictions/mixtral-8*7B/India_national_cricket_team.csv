India_national_cricket_team,What is the ratio of wins to losses for the India national cricket team in the t20i format for 2021?(Answer in decimal form.),1.67,"The ratio of wins to losses for the India national cricket team in the t20i format for 2021 was 4.5:2, which simplifies to 9/4 or 2.25.

[Here's how I calculated it:

In 2021, the India national cricket team played a total of 12 t20i matches, with 9 wins, 2 losses, and 1 no result. So, the ratio of wins to losses is 9:2 or 9/2 = 4.5. But, since there were 2 losses, the decimal form should be calculated as (wins / (wins - losses)) = 9 / (9 - 2) = 9 / 7 = 1.2857 â‰ˆ 2.25 (when rounded to two decimal places).]"
