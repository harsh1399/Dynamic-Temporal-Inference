According to the provided timeline, Richie Berrington became the ODI captain of the Scotland national cricket team on 2022-08-10T17:55:28Z, and the next entry in the timeline at 2022-12-31T15:40:28Z still lists him as the captain. However, there is no record of a new captain being appointed during this time frame. In the next entry, on 2023-02-15T08:53:43Z, the coach is listed as ""To be announced,"" and there is no mention of a new captain at this point either. Therefore, Richie Berrington's tenure as the ODI captain appears to have continued until at least this point, without any new captain being appointed during this time.

However, in the final entry of the timeline, on 2023-12-31T01:55:19Z, the coach is still listed as ""To be announced,"" but there is no update on the ODI captain either. This suggests that Richie Berrington's tenure as the ODI captain has continued uninterrupted since 2022-08-10T17:55:28Z until at least 2023-12-31T01:55:19Z.

Therefore, Richie Berrington's tenure as the ODI captain appears to be the shortest in the timeline, but it is still ongoing at the end of the timeline. The record of his tenure as the captain is 1 second in the entry on 2023-12-31T01:55:19Z, where the coach is listed as ""To be announced"" and there is no mention of a new captain being appointed."

Scotland_national_cricket_team,What is the ratio of wins to losses for the Scotland national cricket team in the odi format for 2021?(Answer in decimal form.),4.0,"The ratio of wins to losses for the Scotland national cricket team in the ODI format for 2021 is 1/1 or 1.0. This is based on their ODI record this year, which shows 1 win and 1 loss out of 2 matches played in 2021."
Scotland_national_cricket_team,What is the ratio of wins to losses for the Scotland national cricket team in the t20i format for 2017?(Answer in decimal form.),3.0,The ratio of wins to losses for the Scotland national cricket team in the t20i format for 2017 is 18/23 or approximately 0.783 in decimal form. This is calculated by dividing the number of wins (18) by the number of losses (23) in the t20i format for the year 2017.
Scotland_national_cricket_team,What is the ratio of wins to losses for the Scotland national cricket team in the odi format for 2017?(Answer in decimal form.),0.19,"The ratio of wins to losses for the Scotland national cricket team in the ODI format for 2017 is 3/4 or 0.75.

This is determined by using the ""odi\_record"" field in the timeline entry for ""2017-12-31T15:45:23Z"", which shows a record of 3 wins and 4 losses (3/4) for the team in the ODI format for that year."
Scotland_national_cricket_team,What is the win to loss ratio of Scotland national cricket team in t20i format in 2021?(Answer in decimal form.),0.62,"The win to loss ratio of Scotland's T20I matches in 2021 is 0.

Here's the reasoning:

1. The timeline provides the T20I record of Scotland in different years.
2. For the year 2021, the T20I record is ""30/34 (1 tie, 3 no result)"".
3. This means that Scotland played 34 T20I matches and won 30 of them.
4. Therefore, the win to loss ratio is 30 (wins) divided by 4 (losses), which equals 7.5.
5. However, the question asks for the answer in decimal form, so the ratio should be 7.5/1 = 7.5 (in decimal form).
6. But the provided timeline does not specify the T20I matches played specifically in 2021, so it seems there were no T20I matches played by Scotland in 2021.
7. Therefore, the win to loss ratio of Scotland's T20I matches in 2021 is 0."
