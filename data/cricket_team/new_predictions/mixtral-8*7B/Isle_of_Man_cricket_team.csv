Isle_of_Man_cricket_team,"How long did Matthew Ansell serve as the t20i captain of Isle of Man cricket team? (answer in number of days)(Assume that tenure for a position starts when the person appears in the timeline in that role and ends when either the timeline ends, or someone else replaces him.)",1230 days,"3 years, 11 months, and 17 days.

Explanation:

- Matthew Ansell first appeared as the t20i captain on August 18, 2020.
- He last appeared in the position on December 31, 2023 (2023-12-31T17:25:08Z).
 
- Between these two dates, there are 3 years, 11 months, and 13 days.
- However, since the first timestamp is already at 21:18:19, we must subtract approximately 17 hours and 13 minutes (from 21:18:19Z to 00:00:00Z of the next day) to find the duration of Matthew Ansell's tenure.
 
- So, the adjusted duration is calculated as follows:
  - 3 years, 11 months, 13 days - 17 hours, 13 minutes 
  - In minutes: 59,029 - 1,033 
  - Result: 57,996 minutes
 
- Let's convert these minutes back to days and hours:
  - 57,996 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 966.6 hours
  - 966.6 hours / 24 hours/day = 40.275 days (rounding down)
 
- Adding the 40.275 days to the 13 days of the final month results in 3 years, 11 months, and 17 days."
