From the timeline, we can see the T20I record in 2021:

`t20i_record_this_year: ""3/5 (0 ties, 0 no result)""`

This means that Ireland won 3 T20I matches and lost 5 matches in 2021.

The win-to-loss ratio is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of losses:

Win-to-loss ratio = 3 (wins) / 5 (losses) = 0.6

So, the win-to-loss ratio of Ireland cricket team in the T20I format in 2021 is 0.6."
