United_States_national_cricket_team,What is the win to loss ratio of United States national cricket team in t20i format in 2022?(Answer in decimal form.),0.67,"To find the win to loss ratio of United States national cricket team in t20i format in 2022, we need to examine the t20i records for 2022.

From the timeline, we can see that the t20i records for 2022 are:

* ""t20i_record"": ""8/6 (1 tie, 1 no result)""
* ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/0 (0 tie, 0 no result)"" (for 2022-01-03T06:38:07Z)
* ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/0 (0 tie, 0 no result)"" (for 2022-05-30T06:07:47Z)
* ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/0 (0 tie, 0 no result)"" (for 2022-06-12T10:22:20Z)

Since there are no wins or losses in 2022, the win to loss ratio is undefined (or 0, depending on the interpretation).

However, if we consider the overall t20i record in 2022, which is ""8/6 (1 tie, 1 no result)"", we can calculate the win to loss ratio as:

 Wins: 8
 Losses: 6
 Ties: 1
 No Results: 1

Let's exclude the tie and no result, and only consider wins and losses. The win to loss ratio would be:

 Wins: 8
 Losses: 6

The win to loss ratio in decimal form is:
8/6 = 1.33

So, the answer is 1.33."
United_States_national_cricket_team,What is the win to loss ratio of United States national cricket team in odi format in 2022?(Answer in decimal form.),1.12,"The win to loss ratio of United States national cricket team in ODI format in 2022 can be calculated as follows:

In 2022, the team played 23 ODIs, with a record of 10/13 (0 ties, 0 no results) as per the timeline.

Wins: 10
Losses: 13

Win to loss ratio = 10/13 = 0.77 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the answer is: 0.77."
