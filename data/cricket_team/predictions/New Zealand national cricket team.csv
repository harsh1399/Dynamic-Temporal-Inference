New Zealand national cricket team,What is the win to loss ratio of New Zealand national cricket team in test format in 2019?,5.0,"To calculate the win to loss ratio of New Zealand national cricket team in test format in 2019, we need to extract the test record for 2019.

From the timeline, we can see that in 2019, the team's test record was:

* On 2019-03-17, the test record was ""97/171, (165 draws)"" and the test record for the year was ""2/0 (0 draws)"".
* On 2019-12-31, the test record was ""99/172, (165 draws)"" and the test record for the year was ""5/1 (0 draws)"".

From these records, we can calculate the number of wins and losses in 2019:

Wins: 5 (2 in the first half of 2019 + 3 in the second half of 2019)
Losses: 1

Now, we can calculate the win to loss ratio:

Win to loss ratio = Wins / Losses = 5 / 1 = 5.0

So, the answer is 5.0."
New Zealand national cricket team,What is the win to loss ratio of New Zealand national cricket team in t20i format in 2021?,1.3,"Based on the timeline, we can see that in 2021, the New Zealand national cricket team's t20i record is:

* ""2021-01-06T04:16:09Z"": {""t20i_record"": ""65/60, (8 ties, 4 no results)""}
* ""2021-05-03T06:22:03Z"": {""t20i_record"": ""71/62, (8 ties, 4 no results)""}
* ""2021-09-03T14:56:38Z"": {""t20i_record"": ""71/64, (8 ties, 4 no results)""}

To calculate the win-to-loss ratio in 2021, we can take the highest wins and losses in 2021, which is 71 wins and 64 losses. The win-to-loss ratio is:

71 (wins) / 64 (losses) = 1.109 (approximately)

So, the win-to-loss ratio of New Zealand national cricket team in t20i format in 2021 is approximately 1.109."
