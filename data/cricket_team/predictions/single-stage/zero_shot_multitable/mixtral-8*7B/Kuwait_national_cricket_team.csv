Explanation:
In 2019, the Kuwait national cricket team played a total of 10 T20Is (refer to ""num\_t20is"" value in the timeline), winning 7 and losing 3.
So, the win to loss ratio for the year 2019 can be calculated as 7 (wins) / 3 (losses) = 2.33. Usually, people prefer this value in decimal form which is the quotient of the number of wins divided by the absolute value of the number of losses, this would result in 7 / abs(3) = 0.75."
