Explanation:
The given timeline shows that in 2019, the Guernsey cricket team played a total of 5 t20i matches (as per the record for 2019-12-31T12:04:02Z). Out of these, the team won 2 matches and lost 5-2 = 3 matches. Hence, the ratio of wins to losses is 2/3 = 0.667 (in decimal form). However, the question asks for the ratio of wins to losses for the year 2019, and the record for 2019-12-31T12:04:02Z shows the t20i record for the entire year 2019. Therefore, the answer is indeed 0.667.
