So, the win to loss ratio is 15/9 = 1.666. However, since the question asks for the ratio in decimal form, we need to convert it to a decimal by dividing the number of wins by the sum of the number of wins and losses.

Win to loss ratio (decimal) = Wins / (Wins + Losses) = 15 / (15+9) = 15 / 24 = 0.625.

Therefore, the win to loss ratio of the Bahrain national cricket team in T20I format in 2022 is approximately 0.625.
