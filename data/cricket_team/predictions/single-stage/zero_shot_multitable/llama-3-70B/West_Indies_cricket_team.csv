West_Indies_cricket_team,"How many total(including ODIs,Tests,T20Is) matches did the West Indies cricket team play between 2018 and 2021? (including both the years)",153,"To find the total number of matches played by the West Indies cricket team between 2018 and 2021, we need to calculate the difference in the number of matches played at the start and end of this period.

From the timeline, we can see that:

* In 2018-01-12T00:31:01Z, the number of tests was 530, number of ODIs was 770, and number of T20Is was 94.
* In 2021-06-27T09:51:54Z, the number of tests was 556, number of ODIs was 828, and number of T20Is was 131.

Now, we can calculate the total number of matches played between 2018 and 2021:

Tests: 556 - 530 = 26
ODIs: 828 - 770 = 58
T20Is: 131 - 94 = 37

Total matches played = 26 + 58 + 37 = 121

So, the West Indies cricket team played a total of 121 matches between 2018 and 2021."

West_Indies_cricket_team,What is the win to loss ratio of West Indies cricket team in test format in 2017?(Answer in decimal form.),0.5,"According to the timeline, in 2017, West Indies cricket team's test record was ""168/187, (174 draws, 1 tie)"". 

From this, we can calculate the win to loss ratio as follows:

Wins = 168, Losses = 187, Draws = 174, Ties = 1

Wins excluding draws and ties = 168 - 174 = -6 (Assuming wins are those that are not draws or ties)

Wins excluding draws and ties = -6 (Negative wins make no sense, so we can say wins are equal to draws plus wins in the given record)

Wins = 174 + 168 = 342

Wins to Losses ratio = 342 / 187 â‰ˆ 1.83

So, the win to loss ratio of West Indies cricket team in test format in 2017 is approximately 1.83."
West_Indies_cricket_team,What is the ratio of wins to losses for the West Indies cricket team in the t20i format for 2020?(Answer in decimal form.),1.0,"To calculate the ratio of wins to losses for the West Indies cricket team in the t20i format for 2020, we need to find the number of wins and losses in 2020.

From the timeline, we can find the t20i record for 2020:

""t20i_record_this_year"": ""2/10, (0 ties, 0 no result)""

This means the West Indies cricket team won 2 and lost 10 t20i matches in 2020.

The ratio of wins to losses is therefore:

2 (wins) / 10 (losses) = 0.2

So, the answer is 0.2."

So, the ratio of wins to losses is 3/5 = 0.6."
West_Indies_cricket_team,What is the win to loss ratio of West Indies cricket team in test format in 2020?(Answer in decimal form.),0.25,"To calculate the win-to-loss ratio, we need to extract the test record for 2020.

From the timeline, we find the test record for 2020:

""test_record_this_year"": ""3/3 (0 draws)""

So, the West Indies cricket team won 3 tests and lost 3 tests in 2020. The win-to-loss ratio is:

3/3 = 1.0

Answer: 1.0"
