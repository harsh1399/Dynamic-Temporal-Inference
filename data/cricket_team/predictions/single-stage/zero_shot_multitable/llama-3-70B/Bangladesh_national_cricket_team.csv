Bangladesh_national_cricket_team,What is the ratio of wins to losses for the Bangladesh national cricket team in the t20i format for 2020?(Answer in decimal form.),1.0,"Based on the provided timeline, I can help answer your question.

For 2020, the t20i record for the Bangladesh national cricket team is:

Ratio = Wins / Losses = 4 / 3 = 1.33

So, the ratio of wins to losses for the Bangladesh national cricket team in the t20i format for 2020 is 1.33."

""2020-05-20T08:16:48Z"": ... ""test_record"": ""14/89 (16 draws)"", ""test_record_this_year"": ""1/1 (0 draws)""

Since the ""test_record_this_year"" is ""1/1 (0 draws)"" at ""2020-05-20T08:16:48Z"", we can infer that the win-loss ratio for 2020 is:

1 (win) / 1 (loss) = 1.0

So, the win to loss ratio of Bangladesh national cricket team in test format in 2020 is 1.0."
