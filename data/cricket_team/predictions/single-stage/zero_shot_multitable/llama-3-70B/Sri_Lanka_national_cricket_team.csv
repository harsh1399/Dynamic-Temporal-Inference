From the timeline, we can find the t20i records for 2019 in the following entries:

* 2019-01-11T15:07:04Z: ""t20i_record"": ""55/54, (1 tie, 1 no result)"", ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/1, (0 ties, 0 no result)""
* 2019-02-26T08:11:00Z: ""t20i_record"": ""55/54, (1 tie, 1 no result)"", ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/1, (0 ties, 0 no result)""
* 2019-06-17T03:21:19Z: ""t20i_record"": ""55/56, (2 ties, 1 no result)"", ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/3, (1 tie, 0 no result)""
* 2019-08-18T06:58:41Z: ""t20i_record"": ""55/56, (2 ties, 1 no result)"", ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/3, (1 tie, 0 no result)""

From these entries, we can calculate the win to loss ratio for 2019 as follows:

Wins: 4
Losses: 8
Ties: 1
No Results: 0

The win to loss ratio can be calculated as:

(Wins / (Wins + Losses)) = (4 / (4 + 8)) = 4/12 = 0.3333

So, the win to loss ratio of Sri Lanka national cricket team in t20i format in 2019 is approximately 0.33."

This means they won 2 and lost 9, with 1 no result. To calculate the ratio of wins to losses, we can divide the number of wins by the number of losses: 2/9 = 0.22."
