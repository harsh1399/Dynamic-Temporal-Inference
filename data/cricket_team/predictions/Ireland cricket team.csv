Ireland cricket team,"How many total(including ODIs,Tests,T20Is) matches did the Ireland cricket team play between 2018 and 2020? (including both years)",73,"To find the total number of matches played by the Ireland cricket team between 2018 and 2020, we need to extract the number of ODIs, Tests, and T20Is played during this period.

From the timeline, we can extract the following information:

* In 2018:
	+ num_odis: 136 (initial) -> 139 (final)
	+ num_tests: 1 (initial) -> 1 (final)
	+ num_t20is: 61 (initial) -> 69 (final)
* In 2020:
	+ num_odis: 156 (initial) -> 159 (final)
	+ num_tests: 3 (initial) -> 3 (final)
	+ num_t20is: 93 (initial) -> 98 (final)

Now, we can calculate the total number of matches played between 2018 and 2020:

* ODIs: 139 - 136 = 3 (in 2018) + 159 - 156 = 3 (in 2020) = 6
* Tests: 1 (in 2018) + 3 - 3 = 1 (in 2020) = 1
* T20Is: 69 - 61 = 8 (in 2018) + 98 - 93 = 5 (in 2020) = 13

In total, the Ireland cricket team played 6 ODIs, 1 Test, and 13 T20Is between 2018 and 2020. Therefore, the total number of matches played is:

6 (ODIs) + 1 (Test) + 13 (T20Is) = 20"
