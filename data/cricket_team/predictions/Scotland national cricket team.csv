To find the ratio of wins to losses in 2022, we need to calculate the wins and losses for 2022.

On August 10, 2022, the ODI record was 56/71, and on December 31, 2022, it was 61/73. So, the wins and losses in 2022 are:

Wins = 61 - 56 = 5
Losses = 73 - 71 = 2

The ratio of wins to losses in 2022 is 5:2 or 2.5 (in decimal form).

Answer: 2.5."
Scotland national cricket team,What is the win to loss ratio of Scotland national cricket team in t20i format in 2021?,0.625,"To find the win to loss ratio of Scotland national cricket team in t20i format in 2021, we need to analyze the data from the timeline.

In 2021, there are four time points: ""2021-01-02T01:33:17Z"", ""2021-05-24T04:25:08Z"", ""2021-09-21T16:14:59Z"", and ""2021-12-31T11:31:00Z"".

From these time points, we can extract the t20i records for 2021:

* ""2021-01-02T01:33:17Z"": ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/0, (0 ties, 0 no result)""
* ""2021-05-24T04:25:08Z"": ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""0/0, (0 ties, 0 no result)""
* ""2021-09-21T16:14:59Z"": ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""1/2, (0 ties, 0 no result)""
* ""2021-12-31T11:31:00Z"": ""t20i_record_this_year"": ""5/8, (0 ties, 0 no result)""

Combining these records, we get a total of 6 wins and 10 losses in 2021.

The win to loss ratio is then 6/10 = 0.6.

So, the answer is 0.6."
