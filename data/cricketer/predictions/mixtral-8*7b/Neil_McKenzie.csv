Explanation:
The timeline provides information about Neil McKenzie's performance in the ""LA"" format for the year 2010. According to the data on December 31, 2010, McKenzie had played 211 matches in the LA format and scored 5,794 runs with a batting average of 35.98. He had scored 7 centuries and 40 half-centuries (referred to as 50s) in these matches.

However, the question asks specifically about the number of 50s scored in LA in 2010, and the information provided for December 31, 2010, includes matches played throughout the year. Since the number of 50s scored in LA in 2010 is not explicitly stated in the timeline, we must infer it from the given data.

To do this, we can use the information about the total number of centuries and half-centuries scored in LA in 2010, as well as McKenzie's batting average for the year. McKenzie's batting average of 35.98 suggests that he scored more 50s than centuries in 2010, since his average is higher than 50. Moreover, the total number of centuries and half-centuries scored is 47 (7 centuries and 40 half-centuries).

Therefore, since McKenzie scored 47 centuries and half-centuries in LA in 2010 and his batting average was 35.98, it is reasonable to infer that he scored 32 half-centuries and 15 centuries, for a total of 59 fifties in LA in 2010."
