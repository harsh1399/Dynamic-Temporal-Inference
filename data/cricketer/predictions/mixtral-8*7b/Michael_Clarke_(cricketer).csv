To get this answer, I reviewed the ""100s/50s"" fields for the Test and ODI entries in the 2010 timeline:
- 2010-01-18T06:20:39Z: 13/17 (Test) + 4/38 (ODI) = 17 100s/50s
- 2010-03-21T11:07:44Z: 14/17 (Test) + 4/38 (ODI) = 18 100s/50s
- 2010-12-31T02:13:11Z: 14/19 (Test) + 4/42 (ODI) = 18 100s/50s
- 2012-04-27T15:24:11Z: 14/22 (Test) + 7/54 (ODI) = 21 100s/50s
