Explanation:
The provided timeline has two entries for the year 2017, one on March 23 and the other on December 31. Let's look at both entries.

1. On March 23, 2017, Hamish Marshall played a total of 306 matches in LA (Limited Overs).
2. On December 31, 2017, the number of LA matches remains the same, 306.

This suggests that Hamish Marshall played 306 matches in LA in 2017."
Hamish_Marshall,How many matches did Hamish Marshall played in FC in 2017?,16,"262 matches. The ""FC"" section in the timeline provides the overall first-class (FC) matches played by Hamish Marshall, and the number of matches doesn't change across the different timestamps. Therefore, Hamish Marshall played 262 first-class matches in total."
Hamish_Marshall,How many 50s did Hamish Marshall score in FC in 2017?,4,"14 50s in FC in 2017.

Explanation:
We can find the number of 50s Hamish Marshall scored in first-class (FC) cricket in 2017 by comparing the ""FC"" data from the two 2017 entries in the timeline.

In the first 2017 entry, the ""FC"" data is as follows:
""FC"": {""matches"": ""262"", ""runs"": ""14,649"", ""bat avg"": ""36.44"", ""100s/50s"": ""30/74"", ""top score"": ""170"", ""deliveries"": ""3,787"", ""wickets"": ""42"", ""bowl avg"": ""45.78"", ""fivefor"": ""0"", ""tenfor"": ""0"", ""best bowling"": ""4/24"", ""catches/stumpings"": ""134/–""}

In the second 2017 entry, the ""FC"" data is as follows:
""FC"": {""matches"": ""262"", ""runs"": ""14,649"", ""bat avg"": ""36.44"", ""100s/50s"": ""30/74"", ""top score"": ""170"", ""deliveries"": ""3,787"", ""wickets"": ""42"", ""bowl avg"": ""45.78"", ""fivefor"": ""0"", ""tenfor"": ""0"", ""best bowling"": ""4/24"", ""catches/stumpings"": ""134/–""}

Since the other cricket formats (Test, ODI, LA) did not have any changes to their ""100s/50s"" values, we can infer that all of Hamish Marshall's 50s in 2017 were scored in first-class cricket. Both 2017 entries in the timeline show that he scored 74 fifties (50s) in first-class cricket.

 To confirm the number of 50s scored in 2017, we can check the difference between the ""FC"" entries for the two 2017 dates:

The first entry for 2017 has ""100s/50s"": ""30/74"", and the second entry for 2017 has the same value: ""30/74"".

So, the number of 50s Hamish Marshall scored in first-class cricket in 2017 was:

74 (total fifties) - 30 (hundreds) = 44 fifties scored in 2017.

However, since the number of 50s shown in the timeline for 2017 is already 44, the correct answer is simply:

14 50s in FC in 2017.

(Note: Analyzing the provided timeline, there are actually 14, not 15, first-class matches in 2017, but the ""FC"" 50s/100s values are consistent with what would be expected from the given data.)"
