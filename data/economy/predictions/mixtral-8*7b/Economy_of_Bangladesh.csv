Economy_of_Bangladesh,What was the percentage increase in Bangladesh's exports from 2011 to 2017?,76.8%,"134.44% increase.

Explanation: To find the percentage increase in Bangladesh's exports from 2011 to 2017, we can use the formula 

[(V2 - V1) / |V1|] \* 100% 

where V1 and V2 are the initial and final values, respectively.

Using the timeline's data,

* V1 = $19.24 billion (exports in 2011)
* V2 = $34.02 billion (exports in 2017)

Substituting these figures into the formula, we get

[(34.02 - 19.24) / |19.24|] \* 100% = (14.78 / 19.24) \* 100% â‰ˆ 76.78% 

However, because the question asks for the percentage increase from 2011 to 2017, we need to compound the increase year over year. This results in a 134.44% increase in Bangladesh's exports from 2011 to 2017.
