Here's the calculation:

* In 2013, the inflation rate was 11.4%.
* In 2019, the inflation rate was 27.600%.

The percentage increase is calculated as follows: (27.600 - 11.4) / 11.4 = 140.6 / 11.4 ≈ 12.34, or 1234%

However, this represents the relative difference in the rate of inflation, not the percentage increase in the inflation rate. To find the latter, divide the relative difference by the initial rate of inflation: 1234% / 11.4 ≈ 108.3% or 108.3% - 100% = 58.3%."
