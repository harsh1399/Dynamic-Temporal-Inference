Economy_of_Myanmar,What was the percentage increase in Myanmar's gdp from 2017 to 2022?,24257.6%,76.27% increase.
Economy_of_Myanmar,What was the percentage increase in Myanmar's imports from 2012 to 2020?,239.8%,"The percentage increase in Myanmar's imports from 2012 to 2020 is approximately 96.6%.

Explanation: To calculate the percentage increase, we first determine the difference between the value of imports in 2020 ($18.68 billion) and 2012 ($5.498 billion), which is $18.68 billion - $5.498 billion = $13.182 billion. Next, we divide this difference by the value of imports in 2012, and multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage increase: ($13.182 billion / $5.498 billion) \* 100 ≈ 239.75%. Since this is a percentage increase over multiple years, we would then subtract 1 from the result and multiply by 100 to get the annualized percentage increase, which is (239.75% - 1) \* (1/8) ≈ 29.97%, or approximately 29.97% per year. However, the question asks for the percentage increase from 2012 to 2020, which is not an annual percentage increase and does not involve multiple years in between. Therefore, we simply divide the difference in values by the value in 2012, and multiply by 100 to get the percentage increase over that time period directly: ($13.182 billion / $5.498 billion) \* 100 ≈ 239.75%.
