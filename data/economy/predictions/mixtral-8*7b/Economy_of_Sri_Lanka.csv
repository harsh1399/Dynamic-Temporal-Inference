Explanation:

I went through each entry in the timeline and checked if the ""revenue"" value was lower than the ""expenses"" value for that year. If it was, I added the year to the list. Here are my findings:

1. 2019-12-31T20:15:13Z: Revenue = $12.07 billion, Expenses = $16.88 billion
2. 2020-12-31T18:34:15Z: Revenue = $12.07 billion, Expenses = $16.88 billion
3. 2021-12-31T06:59:46Z: Revenue = $1,890 million, Expenses = $2,915 million
4. 2022-12-31T15:49:52Z: Revenue = $1,890 million, Expenses = $2,915 million

Since the revenue was lower than expenses in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, I have provided those years as the answer."
