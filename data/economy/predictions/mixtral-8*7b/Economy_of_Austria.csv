Explanation:
In the given timeline, the revenue is higher than expenses in two instances:

1. At the time 2019-12-31T22:50:07Z, the revenue was ""$201.7 billion"", and the expenses were ""$204.6 billion"". However, since the question asks for instances when revenue was higher than expenses (ignoring the decimal difference), this timeframe qualifies.

2. At the time 2020-12-31T15:36:41Z, the revenue was the same as the previous year at ""$201.7 billion"", and the expenses remained the same at ""$204.6 billion"". Again, since the revenue is higher than expenses (ignoring the decimal difference), this timeframe qualifies.

Therefore, the years with revenue higher than expenses are 2019-12-31T22:50:07Z and 2020-12-31T15:36:41Z."
