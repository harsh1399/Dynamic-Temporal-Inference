Explanation:
To calculate the percentage decrease in Egypt's expenses from 2015 to 2021, we first need to identify the initial and final expense values, and then apply the formula for percentage change.

1. From the timeline, the initial expenses in 2015 were $100.8 billion.
2. The final expenses in 2021 were $58 billion.
3. Use the formula: Percentage Change = [(Final Value - Initial Value) / |Initial Value|] * 100%
4. Plug in the values: Percentage Change = [($58 billion - $100.8 billion) / $100.8 billion] * 100%
5. Calculate the result: Percentage Change ≈ -$42.8 billion / $100.8 billion * 100% ≈ -42.4%

Thus, there was a 16.2% decrease in Egypt's expenses from 2015 to 2021. Note that this value is negative, but the question asks for a percentage decrease, so we discard the negative sign."
