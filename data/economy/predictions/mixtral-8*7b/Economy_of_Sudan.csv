Explanation:
For each year in the timeline, I checked if the ""revenue"" value was less than the ""expenses"" value.

* In the year 2011 (""2011-12-31T18:42:57Z""), revenue was $9.046 billion and expenses were $10.83 billion, so revenue was lower.
* In the year 2013 (""2013-12-31T14:16:24Z""), revenue was $9.046 billion and expenses were $10.83 billion, so revenue was lower.
* In the year 2016 (""2016-12-31T01:04:38Z""), revenue was $9.046 billion and expenses were $10.83 billion, so revenue was lower.
* In the year 2018 (""2018-12-31T21:56:16Z""), revenue was $8.48 billion and expenses were $13.36 billion, so revenue was lower.

Therefore, revenue was lower than expenses in all of these years."
