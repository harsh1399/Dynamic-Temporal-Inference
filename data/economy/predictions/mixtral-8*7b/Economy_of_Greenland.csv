Economy_of_Greenland,List all the years in which revenue was higher than expenses.,2012,"2012-12-31T14:15:52Z, 2015-12-31T16:10:38Z, 2019-12-31T01:23:33Z

Explanation:

To find the years where revenue was higher than expenses, we need to compare the revenue and expenses values for each year.

In the provided timeline:

* For the year 2010-12-31T17:19:58Z, revenue was $1.36 billion and expenses were $1.27 billion, so revenue is higher.
* For the year 2012-12-31T14:15:52Z, revenue was $1.47 billion and expenses were $1.51 billion, so expenses are higher.
* For the year 2015-12-31T16:10:38Z, revenue was $1.099 billion and expenses were also $1.099 billion, so revenue and expenses are equal.
* For the year 2019-12-31T01:23:33Z, revenue was $1.099 billion and expenses were also $1.099 billion, so revenue and expenses are equal.

Therefore, the answer is [2010-12-31T17:19:58Z, 2015-12-31T16:10:38Z, 2019-12-31T01:23:33Z], which are the years where revenue was higher than expenses."
