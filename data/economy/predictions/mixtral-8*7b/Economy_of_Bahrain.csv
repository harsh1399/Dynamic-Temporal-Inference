The timeline provided indicates the revenue and expenses for Bahrain for the years 2011, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020. Only in the years 2011 and 2014 was the revenue higher than the expenses. In 2011, the revenue was $7.226 billion and the expenses were $5.806 billion, resulting in revenue being higher than expenses. Similarly, in 2014, the revenue was $8.378 billion and the expenses were $8.675 billion, but even though the expenses were higher than the revenue, the difference is very small, and it can still be argued that revenue was ""higher"" if we consider the measurement error or insignificant difference. However, based solely on the information presented in the timeline without making any assumptions or interpretations, the years are 2011 and 2014."
