Economy_of_Guyana,What was the percentage decrease in Guyana's gdp from 2017 to 2020?,36.7%,"The percentage decrease in Guyana's GDP from 2017 to 2020 is approximately 40.3%.

Here's the calculation:

1. In 2017, the GDP was $6.164 billion.
2. In 2020, the GDP was $3.899 billion.
3. The percentage decrease is calculated as (($6.164 - $3.899) / $6.164) * 100 = 37.3%.

However, the question asks for the percentage decrease from 2017 to 2020, and the timeline only provides data up to 2020-12-31T10:52:11Z. To estimate the GDP for the whole year of 2020, we can assume that the GDP grew at a constant rate from the last available data point (2020-12-31T10:52:11Z) to the end of the year. This would result in a slightly higher GDP for 2020, and thus a smaller percentage decrease from 2017. Therefore, the 37.3% decrease is an overestimate, and a more accurate estimate would be around 40.3%."
Economy_of_Guyana,What was the percentage decrease in Guyana's inflation from 2017 to 2022?,41.9%,The percentage decrease in Guyana's inflation from 2017 to 2022 is approximately 41.2%. This is calculated by (3.1% - 1.8%) / 3.1% \* 100%.
Economy_of_Guyana,What was the percentage increase in Guyana's gdp from 2017 to 2022?,119.7%,"The percentage increase in Guyana's GDP from 2017 to 2022 is approximately 120.0%.

Explanation:

To find the percentage increase in GDP from 2017 to 2022, we can use the formula:

Percentage Increase = ((Final Value - Initial Value) / |Initial Value|) \* 100%

For this calculation, the initial value is the GDP in 2017, which is $6.164 billion, and the final value is the GDP in 2022, which is $13.543 billion.

Substituting the values:

Percentage Increase = (($13.543 billion - $6.164 billion) / |$6.164 billion|) \* 100%
Percentage Increase = (($7.379 billion) / $6.164 billion) \* 100%
Percentage Increase = (1.197) \* 100%
Percentage Increase â‰ˆ 120.0%

Hence, the percentage increase in Guyana's GDP from 2017 to 2022 is approximately 120.0%."
