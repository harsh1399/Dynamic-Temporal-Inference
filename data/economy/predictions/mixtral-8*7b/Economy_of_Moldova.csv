Economy_of_Moldova,What was the percentage increase in Moldova's gdp from 2019 to 2022?,21.1%,"The percentage increase in Moldova's GDP from 2019 to 2022 is 19.4%.

Explanation:
In 2019, Moldova's GDP was $11.404 billion.
In 2022, Moldova's GDP was $13.811 billion.
To find the percentage change, we can use the formula:
(new value - old value) / |old value| \* 100%
(13.811 - 11.404) / |11.404| \* 100% = 19.4%

Note: The value of ""debt"" in the 2022 data point appears to be the same as in the 2019 data point. However, I have assumed that this is an error and have not used it in the calculation."
Economy_of_Moldova,What was the percentage increase in Moldova's inflation from 2019 to 2022?,11.4%,"Inflation increased by approximately 1.4%.

Here's the calculation:

2022 inflation = 3.7%
2019 inflation = 3.321%

Increase in inflation = 2022 inflation - 2019 inflation
= 3.7% - 3.321%
= 0.379%

To express this as a percentage increase:
(0.379% / 3.321%) x 100% â‰ˆ 11.4%

However, the question asks about the percentage increase from 2019 to 2022, so:
Percentage increase = 1.4%

Therefore, Moldova's inflation increased by approximately 1.4% from 2019 to 2022."
