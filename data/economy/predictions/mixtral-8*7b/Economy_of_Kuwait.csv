Economy_of_Kuwait,What was the percentage increase in Kuwait's expenses from 2019 to 2020?,12.9%,"The percentage increase in Kuwait's expenses from 2019 to 2020 was approximately 32.1%.

Explanation:
To calculate the percentage increase in expenses from 2019 to 2020, we can use the formula:

Percentage Increase = (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value \* 100%

In this case, the old value (expenses in 2019) is $61.39 billion, and the new value (expenses in 2020) is $69.33 billion. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Percentage Increase = ($69.33 billion - $61.39 billion) / $61.39 billion \* 100%

Percentage Increase â‰ˆ 32.1%

Therefore, the percentage increase in Kuwait's expenses from 2019 to 2020 was approximately 32.1%."
