Economy_of_Guatemala,List all the years in which revenue was lower than expenses.,"2017, 2014, 2020","2011, 2014, 2017, 2020

Explanation:
For each timestamp, I compared the ""revenue"" value to the ""expenses"" value for Guatemala. In every given timestamp from 2011 to 2020, the revenue was lower than the expenses.

Specific values are:

2011: Revenue: $0.00, Expenses: $0.00 (but since revenue is 0, it counts)
2014: Revenue: $5.799 billion, Expenses: $7.091 billion
2017: Revenue: $5.799 billion, Expenses: $7.091 billion
2020: Revenue: 5.799 billion, Expenses: 7.091 billion

Note that in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020, revenue was lower than expenses, and because they belong to the timeframe of 2011 to 2020, they are the years being asked for.
