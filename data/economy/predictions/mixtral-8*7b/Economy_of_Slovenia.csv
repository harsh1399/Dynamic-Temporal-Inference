Here's how I arrived at this answer:

1. Retrieve the revenue figures for 2018 and 2019 from the provided timeline:
   - 2018 revenue: ""8,52 billion""
   - 2019 revenue: ""20.02 billion""

2. Calculate the absolute difference between the two revenue figures:
   - Absolute difference: 20.02 - 8.52 = 11.50 billion

3. Calculate the percentage difference by dividing the absolute difference by the 2018 revenue and multiplying by 100:
   - Percentage decrease: (11.50 / 8.52) \* 100 â‰ˆ 0.26%

Please note that the revenue figures in the timeline are given in a different format than the standard scientific E-notation. I have assumed they represent the same value for consistency."
Economy_of_Slovenia,What was the percentage decrease in Slovenia's gdp from 2018 to 2019?,5.0%,"The percentage decrease in Slovenia's GDP from 2018 to 2019 was approximately 0.9%.

To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:

0.04028538157630655 \* 100 = 4.028538157630655%

So, the percentage decrease is roughly 0.9% when rounding to the nearest whole number."

* In 2018, revenue was ""8.52 billion"" and expenses were ""9.80 billion"", so revenue was lower than expenses.
* In 2019, revenue was ""20.02 billion"" and expenses were ""19.92 billion"", so revenue was higher than expenses.
* In 2020, revenue was ""20.02 billion"" and expenses were ""19.92 billion"", so revenue was higher than expenses.
* Therefore, the years in which revenue was lower than expenses are 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020."
