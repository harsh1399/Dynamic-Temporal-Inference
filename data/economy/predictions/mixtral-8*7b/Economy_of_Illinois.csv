Explanation:
To calculate this, we first need to find the GDP values for the two years in question, which are $528 billion for 2011 and $865.310 billion for 2019.

Next, we use the formula (GDP in 2019 - GDP in 2011) / GDP in 2011 \* 100% to calculate the percentage increase.

So the calculation is as follows:

($865.310 billion - $528 billion) / $528 billion \* 100% = 63.466%

Therefore, the percentage increase in Illinois's GDP from 2011 to 2019 is approximately 63.5%."
