Economy_of_Colombia,What was the percentage decrease in Colombia's exports from 2011 to 2020?,1.9%,"Approximately 1.6% decrease.

Explanation:
Comparing the export values of Colombia between the years 2011 and 2020, the value in 2020 was ""$39.48 billion"" and in 2011 was ""$40.24 billion"". To calculate the percentage change, we subtract the value in 2011 from the value in 2020, divide the result by the 2011 value, and multiply by 100.

Percentage change = [(Value in 2020 - Value in 2011) / Value in 2011] x 100

Percentage change = [($39.48 billion - $40.24 billion) / $40.24 billion] x 100

Percentage change = (-$0.76 billion / $40.24 billion) x 100

Percentage change ≈ -0.0189 x 100

Percentage change ≈ -1.89%

However, since we are rounding to the nearest whole number, the percentage decrease in Colombia's exports from 2011 to 2020 is approximately 1.6%."

Economy_of_Colombia,List all the years in which imports were higher than exports.,2011,"2015, 2017, 2019, 2020

Explanation:
The provided timeline contains several data points for Colombia in different years. To find the years in which imports were higher than exports, I compared the ""imports"" and ""exports"" values for each data point. The years where imports were higher than exports are:

1. 2015-12-31T23:14:07Z: Imports = $56.8 billion, Exports = $55.0 billion
2. 2017-12-31T00:32:53Z: Imports = $56.8 billion, Exports = $55.0 billion
3. 2019-12-31T20:55:58Z: Imports = $44.24 billion, Exports = $39.48 billion
4. 2020-12-31T09:40:58Z: Imports = $44.24 billion, Exports = $39.48 billion
