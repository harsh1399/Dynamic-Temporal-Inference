Explanation:
The revenue in 2017 was $1.58 billion, while in 2019 it was $2.276 billion. To find the percentage increase, first calculate the difference between the two numbers: $2.276 billion - $1.58 billion = $0.696 billion. Then divide this difference by the original amount and multiply by 100: ($0.696 billion / $1.58 billion) \* 100 = 44.58%. However, the question asks for the percentage increase, and not the percentage point change, so you should divide the difference by the original amount and multiply by 100 to get the percentage increase: (0.696 billion / 1.58 billion) x 100 = 44.11%. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this is a 4.1% increase."
