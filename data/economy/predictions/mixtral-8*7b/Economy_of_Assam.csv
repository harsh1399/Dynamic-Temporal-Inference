Economy_of_Assam,What was the percentage increase in Assam's debt from 2018 to 2020?,10.8%,"The percentage increase in Assam's debt from 2018 to 2020 was 1.15%.

Explanation:
In 2018, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 17.6%, and in 2020, it was 19.5%.
To find the percentage increase, we can use the following formula:
(new value - old value) / old value \* 100%

So, the calculation would be: (19.5 - 17.6) / 17.6 \* 100% = 1.15%

It's important to note that the revenue, expenses, and balance for 2021 seem to have incorrect values in the provided timeline, but the answer to the question only depends on the debt-to-GDP ratio for 2018 and 2020."
