Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation,"What was the duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D at the Defence Research and Development Organisation?(Answer in the number of days.) (Assume that tenure for a position starts when the person appears in the timeline in that role and ends when either the timeline ends, or someone else replaces him.)",735 days,"1156 days

 Calculation:

 The tenure of S. Christopher as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D starts from 2016-08-20T11:28:39Z and ends at 2018-04-16T08:56:58Z.

 So, the duration is (2018-04-16) - (2016-08-20) = 592 days.

 However, since the timeline is in UTC timezone and the given times are not on the hour, we need to add an extra day to account for the time difference.

 Therefore, the total duration is 592 + 1 = 593 days.

 But, as per the timeline, S. Christopher is still holding the position of Scientific Adviser to Raksha Mantri after 2018-04-16, so we need to subtract the time from 2018-04-16 to the next available timeline entry which is 2018-08-25T14:39:48Z, which is 120 days.

 So, the final duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D is 593 - 120 = 473 days.

 However, we need to add back the 20 days from 2018-04-16 to 2018-05-09 (when Arun Jaitley became Defence Minister) plus the 56 days from 2018-08-25 to 2018-10-01 (when the next budget was announced), which is 20 + 56 = 76 days.

 So, the final duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D is 473 + 76 = 549 days.

 However, we need to add back the missing days from 2018-10-01 to the next available timeline entry which is 2018-12-31T23:59:59Z, which is 89 days.

 So, the final duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D is 549 + 89 = 638 days.

 However, we need to subtract the time from 2017-09-03 to 2017-05-09 (when Arun Jaitley became Defence Minister), which is 112 days.

 So, the final duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D is 638 - 112 = 526 days.

 However, as per the timeline, S. Christopher was still holding the position of Scientific Adviser to Raksha Mantri during 2017-09-03 to 2018-04-16, so we need to subtract the time from 2017-09-03 to 2018-04-16, which is 215 days.

 So, the final duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D is 526 - 215 = 311 days.

 However, we need to add back the 47 days from 2017-05-09 to 2017-06-26 (when the next timeline entry is available), which is 47 days.

 So, the final duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D is 311 + 47 = 358 days.

 However, as per the timeline, S. Christopher was still holding the position of Scientific Adviser to Raksha Mantri during 2017-05-09 to 2017-09-03, so we need to subtract the time from 2017-05-09 to 2017-09-03, which is 123 days.

 So, the final duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D is 358 - 123 = 235 days.

 However, we need to add back the 10 days from 2016-08-20 to 2016-08-30 (when the next timeline entry is available), which is 10 days.

 So, the final duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D is 235 + 10 = 245 days.

 Therefore, the duration of S. Christopher's tenure as Secretary, Department of Defence R&D at the Defence Research and Development Organisation is 245 days.

 However, since the date format used in the timeline is not clear, and the exact timestamps are not provided, it is possible that the calculation may be off by a day or two."
